For this assignment we were tasked to create a social media web app.
This was a culmination of every thing we had learned up to this point in this Class.
Creating, modifing and deleting accounts.
Allowing users to post and edit/delete their own posts without edit or deleting other users posts.
Making various "user roles" to allow Moderators, Admins, and Theme Managers.
Using Migrations to create and save all data to a database.


Our assignment required us to develop a social media web application which incorporated all the skills and knowledge we had gained in this course. This involved implementing features such as user account creation, modification, and deletion, as well as enabling users to create, edit, and delete their own posts without affecting other users' content. Additionally, we created different user roles, including Moderators, Admins, and Theme Managers. To save all data to a database, we utilized Migrations.

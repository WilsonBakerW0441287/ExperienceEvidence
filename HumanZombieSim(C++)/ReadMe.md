For this assignment we were tasked to create a life simulator.
In this Life Sim there are Humans and Zombies. Humans can move in 4 directions (N,S,E,W), And Zombies can move in 8 (N,NE,WN,S,SE,SW,E,W).<br>
If a human has existed on the grid for 3 "moves" they will become a zombie.<br>
If a zombie has existed on the grid for 8 "moves" they will die.<br>
The grid is 20x20 and the humans and zombies are placed on the grid.<br>
The program will run until either all humans or all zombies are dead.<br>
The program outputs the grid to the console every move.
